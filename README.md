# DiabetesProtocol
Identifying healthcare protocols to improve Diabetic Patient care

# Objective: find improvements in hospital care for diabetic patients.
# Problem statement: Identify possible diabetes care hospital care attributes that can lead to better diabetes management. Problem type is classification. Outcome of classification can suggest changes, if any, to hospitalization protocols to improve diabetic patient well-being.

# Dataset: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008
number of records: 101,766
number of features: 52

# Data Preperation:
Clean per script - correlations, null values, out of range, outliers mgmt
Assess a featureâ€™s relevance to classification problem at hand and as described in earlier sections.
Engineered features added to raw and cleaned database
Data transformations - one hot encoding, feature engineering based feature transformations, Feature Normalization, Data balancing for identified problem sets

# Performance:
Confusion matrix Accuracy, and ROC AUC 

# Finalized data mining algorithm:
Decision Tree based Random Forests. Other algorithms explored prior to down selection, please check the repo
